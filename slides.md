Speaking notes:
Use this slide to set the frame quickly.

Hit five points:
- Problem in one sentence: fragmented process, hard to see status or compare options.
- What P.I.T.C.H. is: a workflow and data model for ideas to IJs to Business Cases.
- Why it matters: accelerates work, improves decisions, strengthens controls, and aligns with F26 priorities.
- How we’ll do it: focused pilot in 1–2 portfolios, measure, then refine and scale.
- What we need: sponsorship, a clear pilot mandate, decision gates, and configuration/SME capacity.

Don’t go into detail yet—this is just the headline story.

  <strong>Vision:</strong> Accelerate decisions while protecting safety, controls, and affordability
</div>

<!--
Speaking notes:
Anchor the pain and opportunity.

Use one concrete example: reconciling multiple spreadsheets/emails just to answer a simple status question.

Explain systemic problems:
- Status scattered across tools and people.
- Low visibility and late alignment between Business, IT, and Capital Planning.
- No consistent way to prioritize or see trade-offs.
- No single roadmap view.

Then frame the opportunity: a single integrated, auditable workflow and dataset that standardizes key fields and provides end-to-end visibility and portfolio reporting.

# Change Impact Assessment

- **Overall impact:** *Moderate–High* – significant change to **how** we manage IJs/BCs, with mitigations to protect Finance and control processes.

## Process (High)

- Move from unstructured email + documents to a **standardized, state-driven workflow** with clear gates and SLAs
- Impacted: IT Planners, BSS IT Advisors, Capital Planning, Portfolio Owners, PMO

## Roles & Responsibilities (Medium–High)

- Clearer RACI for idea sponsors, approvers, reviewers
- Formalized ownership of data and decisions
- Impacted: sponsors, approvers, governance committees

## Tools & Data (Medium)

- New system of engagement (P.I.T.C.H.) becomes the **single place to look** for IJ/BC status and portfolio view
- Impacted: users currently relying on SharePoint spreadsheets, email, and local trackers

## Culture & Ways of Working (Medium)

- Shift from “heroic chasing” and local workarounds to **transparent, data-driven, standardized** processes
- Impacted: all stakeholders involved in planning and decision-making

## Mitigations

- Co-designed workflow with key users
- Playbooks and “definition of ready/done”
- Office hours and initial white-glove support
- Dual-running during pilot and migration of critical in-flight items
- Export functions for users who still need spreadsheets
- Communities of practice and recognition for effective use

<!--
Speaking notes:
Explain that the impact is meaningful but manageable.

Walk each dimension:
- Process: big change, but adds clarity and predictability.
- Roles: clearer RACI and ownership of data/decisions.
- Tools/data: new system of engagement.
- Culture: from chasing to transparent, standardized processes.

Then emphasize mitigations: co-design, playbooks, strong support in pilot, dual-running and export options, communities of practice, recognition for good adoption.
-->

# Action & Ask Plan

## Near-Term Actions (Pilot)

- Confirm **pilot scope and portfolios** (1–2 portfolios with mixed complexity)
- Configure workflow platform with standard templates, fields, and approval paths
- Run pilot for a defined period (e.g., one planning cycle) with:
  - Baseline and post-pilot measurement of KPIs
  - Office hours and support
  - Feedback loops to refine configuration

## Scale-Up Path (Post-Pilot)

- Decide whether to **iterate, scale, or stop** based on pilot KPIs and stakeholder feedback
- If scaling:
  - Incorporate learnings into a **standard playbook**
  - Extend to additional portfolios
  - Refine integrations (e.g., AIPS exports)

## Asks from Leadership

- **Sponsor & champion**
  - Visible executive sponsorship to support adoption and anchor decisions
- **Endorse pilot mandate**
  - Agreement that selected pilot portfolios **use P.I.T.C.H. as the primary path** for IJs/BCs during the pilot
- **Resourcing**
  - Part-time capacity for:
    - Platform admin/configuration
    - BA/Designer
    - Data/reporting support
    - Key SMEs from Capital Planning / IT Advisors
- **Decision points**
  - Agreed **success criteria** and **decision gate** after the pilot:
    - Proceed to scale, iterate further, or stop

<!--
Speaking notes:
Be explicit about what happens next and what you need.

Summarize near-term pilot actions: scope, configure, run with KPIs and support.

Explain the scale-up path: iterate/scale/stop based on evidence; if scaling, codify learning in a playbook and extend with refined integrations.

State the asks clearly: sponsorship, pilot mandate, resourcing, and agreed decision points.

Invite them to view this as a low-risk, learning-oriented step.

# P.I.T.C.H.: High-Level Approach

- **Discover**
  - Map current-state processes, pain points, and control inventory
  - Identify stakeholders and RACI
  - Baseline timings (Idea→IJ, IJ→BC, approval cycle times)
- **Define**
  - Agree on **target data model**, workflow states, approval matrix, and “definition of ready/done”
  - Decide how costs by quarter, risk/benefit, and controls will be captured
- **Pilot**
  - Implement an MVP with 1–2 portfolios
  - Define explicit **success criteria** and “kill/iterate” thresholds
- **Evaluate**
  - Measure cycle time, approval SLA performance, audit exceptions, decision latency, data completeness
  - Capture qualitative feedback from users and leadership
- **Scale**
  - Roll out to additional portfolios with **change management, training, templates, guardrails, and support**
  - Embed dashboards into regular governance forums
- **Govern**
  - Maintain a **control matrix** with automated checks, privacy/security controls, and audit requirements
  - Run periodic retrospectives and KPI reviews to drive continuous improvement

<!--
Speaking notes:
Reinforce that this is a staged, learning-led approach.

Briefly explain each step:
- Discover: understand current processes, pain points, and controls; baseline metrics.
- Define: finalize target data model, workflow, approvals, definitions of ready/done.
- Pilot: MVP in 1–2 portfolios with clear success and kill/iterate criteria.
- Evaluate: use KPIs and feedback to assess speed, quality, and controls.
- Scale: extend to more portfolios with structured change management and governance integration.
- Govern: maintain ongoing controls and continuous improvement.

Tie back to the executive summary: P.I.T.C.H. can be tested and evolved with low risk and clear evidence.
