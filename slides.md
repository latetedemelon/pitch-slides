# Problem & Opportunity

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

## Current Problems

<v-clicks>

- **Difficult to track status**
  - Scattered across tools
  
- **Low visibility & late alignment**
  - Ideas surface too late
  
- **No consistent prioritization**
  - Everything competes equally
  
- **No shared roadmap**
  - Can't see the funnel

</v-clicks>

</div>

<div>

## The Opportunity

<v-clicks>

**Integrated, auditable workflow:**

- ✓ Standardized data capture
- ✓ End-to-end visibility
- ✓ Automated approvals
- ✓ Portfolio dashboards

</v-clicks>

</div>

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-6 text-center p-3 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-green-50 rounded">
  <strong>Vision:</strong> Accelerate decisions while protecting safety, controls, and affordability
</div>

<!--
Speaking notes:
Anchor the pain and opportunity.

Use one concrete example: reconciling multiple spreadsheets/emails just to answer a simple status question.

Explain systemic problems:
- Status scattered across tools and people.
- Low visibility and late alignment between Business, IT, and Capital Planning.
- No consistent way to prioritize or see trade-offs.
- No single roadmap view.

Then frame the opportunity: a single integrated, auditable workflow and dataset that standardizes key fields and provides end-to-end visibility and portfolio reporting.

# Insights from Listening

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">

<div>

## Who we listened to

<v-clicks>

- Capital Planning & Finance
- IT Planners & BSS Advisors
- Portfolio / Program Owners
- PMO / Project Managers

</v-clicks>

## What we heard

<v-clicks>

<div class="bch-quote text-sm">
"Hours reconciling <strong>spreadsheet versions</strong>"
</div>

<div class="bch-quote text-sm">
"No <strong>single place</strong> to see IJ status"
</div>

<div class="bch-quote text-sm">
"Hard to compare <strong>like-for-like</strong>"
</div>

</v-clicks>

</div>

<div>

## How this shaped P.I.T.C.H.

<v-clicks>

- **Finance stays system of record**
  - P.I.T.C.H. handles intake/workflow
  
- **Pilot before scale**
  - Prove value in 1–2 portfolios
  
- **Dashboards & templates**
  - Canonical data model
  
- **Guided submissions**
  - Validation & help text

</v-clicks>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Speaking notes:
Show the design is grounded in conversations, not theory.

Summarize who you spoke with: Capital Planning/Finance, IT Planners/BSS Advisors, Portfolio Owners, PMO/PMs.

Highlight 2–3 key pain points:
- Time spent reconciling spreadsheets.
- No single source of truth for status and next actions.
- Finance's concern about extra steps and quarter-end timelines.

Then link to design decisions:
- Finance remains system of record; P.I.T.C.H. covers intake/decision and exports out.
- Pilot and phased rollout.
- Dashboards and templates as essentials.
- Guided submissions and clear definitions of ready/done.

-->

---

# Action & Ask Plan

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">

<div>

### Near-Term Actions (Pilot)

- Confirm **pilot scope and portfolios** (1–2 portfolios with mixed complexity)
- Configure workflow platform with standard templates, fields, and approval paths
- Run pilot for a defined period (e.g., one planning cycle) with:
  - Baseline and post-pilot measurement of KPIs
  - Office hours and support
  - Feedback loops to refine configuration

### Scale-Up Path (Post-Pilot)

- Decide whether to **iterate, scale, or stop** based on pilot KPIs and stakeholder feedback
- If scaling:
  - Incorporate learnings into a **standard playbook**
  - Extend to additional portfolios
  - Refine integrations (e.g., AIPS exports)

</div>

<div>

### Asks from Leadership

- **Sponsor & champion**
  - Visible executive sponsorship to support adoption and anchor decisions
- **Endorse pilot mandate**
  - Agreement that selected pilot portfolios **use P.I.T.C.H. as the primary path** for IJs/BCs during the pilot
- **Resourcing**
  - Part-time capacity for:
    - Platform admin/configuration
    - BA/Designer
    - Data/reporting support
    - Key SMEs from Capital Planning / IT Advisors
- **Decision points**
  - Agreed **success criteria** and **decision gate** after the pilot:
    - Proceed to scale, iterate further, or stop

</div>

</div>

<!--
Speaking notes:
Be explicit about what happens next and what you need.

Summarize near-term pilot actions: scope, configure, run with KPIs and support.

Explain the scale-up path: iterate/scale/stop based on evidence; if scaling, codify learning in a playbook and extend with refined integrations.

State the asks clearly: sponsorship, pilot mandate, resourcing, and agreed decision points.

Invite them to view this as a low-risk, learning-oriented step.
